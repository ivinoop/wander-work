## Our Current Version 

  - We have focused on building the UI, and presenting the aim of our platform. The current features are as follows -
    
    - The home page consists of a layout in which the most popular places for remote developers, are featured. These are presented in the form of cards, which are dynamically populated via DOM. The information for each card is fed by way of objects in JavaScript. 
    - On clicking a card, information is shown as a pop-up with details on cost of living, climate, etc. 
  
  - Currently two pages are built - index.html (home page) and jobs.html (Job Boards, which can be acccessed by clicking on the 'Remote Jobs' option in the menu).
